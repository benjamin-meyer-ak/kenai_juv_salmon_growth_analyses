# Introduction

This document records selected analyses undertaken in the Transactions of the American Fisheries Society (TAFS) manuscript by Meyer et al., in review April 2022. The document outlines the modifications to analyses requested by the anonymous reviewers.


The current draft in progress of the manuscript, along with the draft response to the TAFS decision letter, can be accessed at this link: https://bit.ly/bmeyer_tafs_submission

### General approach

2015-2016 inputs to generate p-values, use p-values and projected water temperatures for simulations of 2030-2039 and 2060-2069 growth.
